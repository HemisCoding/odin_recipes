    <p>Nobody makes casserole like your Grandma. That's why this old-fashioned ground beef casserole with egg noodles is always such a hit! It's made with ingredients you already have on hand (and, of course, a little bit of love). </p>
    
    <ol>
    <li><h2>Ground Beef</h2></li>
    <p> Of course, you'll need ground beef for this casserole. The recipe calls for about one pound.  </p>
    
    <li><h2>Tomato Sauce</h2></li>
    <p>Canned tomato sauce adds flavor and helps bring the casserole together. </p>
    
    <li><h2>Seasonings</h2></li>
    <p>White sugar, salt, and garlic salt are used to add flavor to the tomato sauce. </p>
    
    </ol>
